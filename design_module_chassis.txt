  skos:definition         "The Chassis module is responsible for the various mounting solutions for the lidar, including, but not limited to, mounting on a nacelle, a meteorological tower, the ground, a floating platform, or a mobile structure. The module must contain accelerometers and other sensors that can be interfaced with the Control module in order to adjust for measurement errors due to the movement of the lidar system. In addition to this, it should contain stabilizers and mechanisms for easy and secure installation, and should be operate in a wide range of atmospheric conditions. "@en ;
