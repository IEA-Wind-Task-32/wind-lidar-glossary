The scan geometry ensures measurements are acquired throughout the measurement volume sufficient for wind field reconstruction. The sequence of beam orientations may be repeated to acquire a time series of final data acquired from each iteration. Scans may be performed in stop-stare or sweep-stare mode. 2. The collection of lines of sight / beam orientations along which the lidar is programmed to emit its probe."@en ;
