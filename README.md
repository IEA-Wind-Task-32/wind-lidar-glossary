# Wind lidar glossary
This repository provides the source for a glossary of terms for wind lidar. This glossary can be used to help organise and explore data, publications and software.

For a human-friendly version of the repository, see the [the online viewer](https://data.windenergy.dtu.dk/ontologies/view/IEATask32Glossary/en/).

## Glossary, ontology, taxonomy, ...
The Task 32 wind lidar glossary is a controlled vocabulary about wind lidar that includes a hierarchy, synonyms, and interrelationships. This is often called an [_ontology_](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390211).

## Implementation
The glossary is built from information contained in the text files in this repository. 

Each branch of the glossary - e.g., `applications`, `devices`, or `measurement principles` - has its own file. These files are then automaticaly concatenated with the headers needed for the glossary (in `00_headers.txt`), and imported in to the viewer.
