# Reference designs

This directory contains a concept for describing lidar designs using a YAML format that corresponds to the lidar ontology.

These designs can also function as reference designs; some first ideas are included in this directory. They include:
1. A staring lidar ([`staring_lidar.yml`](staring_lidar.yml)).

Other reference designs are anticipated:
2. A lidar with variable focal length / measurement distance
3. A lidar with fixed elevation and variable azimuth
4. A lidar with variable elevation, azimuth and measurement distance.

Are there other reference designs that we should be including? Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/IEA-Wind-Task-32/wind-lidar-glossary/issues/new)!
